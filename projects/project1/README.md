# Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Online Retail Dataset

## Overview

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using the **Online Retail** dataset sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains detailed transactional information from online retail store between December 2010 and December 2011, including invoice numbers, product descriptions, quantities sold, unit prices, and customer data.


## Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to uncover meaningful insights into sales patterns and trends, such as:
- Total sales and average transaction values
- Identification of top-selling products
- Time-series analysis of sales trends over time
- Insights into customer purchasing behavior

These insights will serve as a foundation for future predictive modeling aimed at forecasting future sales and optimizing business strategies.
